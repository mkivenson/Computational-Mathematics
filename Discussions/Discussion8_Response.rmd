## Question 3
The following function prints the results of 10 batches of 1,000 rolls each (cumulative results)

```{r}
toss10k <- function(){
  batch = list()
  for (i in 1:30){
    n <- i * 1000
    trial <- rbinom(n=1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
    batch[[i]] <- sum(trial)
    diff <- Reduce("+", batch) - (n/2)
    cat("In batch",i,"we have Sn = ",Reduce("+", batch), "and Sn - n/2 =", diff, "and heads rate of", round(Reduce("+", batch)/n,3), ".\n")
  }
}

toss10k()
```

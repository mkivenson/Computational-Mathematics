## Solution

To find a solution for:

$$\rho_B(y)$$

it is necessary to find scalars:

$$a_1, a_2, a_3$$ 

such that:

$$y = a_1u_1 + a_2u_2 + a_3u_3$$

We get the following system of equations:

2a + 1b + 3c = 11

-2a + 3b + 5c = 5

2a + 1b + 2c = 8

We can solve this using matrix row operations and substitution.

```{r}
A = rbind(c(2,1,3,11),c(-2,3,5,5),c(2,1,2,8))
print(A)
```

First, subtract row 1 from row 3.

```{r}
A[3,] = A[3,] - A[1,]
print(A)
```

From this step, we get that -1c = -3. Solving for c, we get **c = 3**. We can substitute this into the system of equations and create a new matrix:

2a + 1b + 3(3) = 11

-2a + 3b + 5(3) = 5


The equations above become this:

2a + 1b = 2

-2a + 3b = -10

Adding the two equations together, we get:

4b = -8

**b = -2**

Finally, solving for a, we get:

2a - 2 = 2

2a = 4

**a = 2**

Therefore, the representation is:


$$\rho_B(y) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 
2\\
-2\\
3 
\end{array}\right)$$:

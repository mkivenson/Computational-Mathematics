# Regression - HW 11

## Question 1 {.tabset}

Using the “cars” dataset in R, build a linear model for stopping distance as a function of speed and replicate the analysis of your textbook chapter 3 (visualization, quality evaluation of the model, and residual analysis.)

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 6)
```

### Visualization

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 6)
```

### Linear Model Function

### Evaluating Model Quality

### Residual Analysis
